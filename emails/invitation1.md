1. Version for former competitors


Dear XYZ,

ICAPS 2023 will feature the next edition of the International Planning Competition. This will also include the second time that a track on hierarchical planning will be part of the IPC.

Since you have taken part in the first edition of the IPC's HTN track, we wanted to ask whether you plan to participate in this year's edition as well?
You can find details about the IPC HTN track at: https://ipc2023-htn.github.io/

The deadline for the initial planner submission is February the 28th. As in 2020, we will use a container software for planners. In fact we will use the same software, which has been re-named from Singularity to Apptainer. I.e. most of the basic setup will remain the same.
It would be helpful to us (to get our internal processes started), if we could set up submissions as early as possible - even if it is just a git respository containing only the Singularity file for controlling the the conainer and no code whatsoever.

If you can't or don't want to participate with a planner, we are also still looking for domains to use as benchmarks. If you have any, then please let us know! A rough idea for a domain would also be appreciated!


Kind regards,
Ron, Dominik, Gregor



2. Version for non-competitors

Dear XYZ,

As you may have heard, ICAPS 2023 will feature the next edition of the International Planning Competition. This will also include eidition of the track on hierarchical planning in the IPC.

We are currently reaching out to interested members of the (hierarchical-) planning community to ask them whether they want to participate in the competition.

Given your past research and activity within the HTN community, we thought that you might be interested to participate in the IPC's HTN track.
We are trying to make participating as easy as possible to you. The competition will roughly have the same setting as the past IPC 2020. I.e. you can use all its material (e.g., example domains and problem) as help for your own planner. If you require any special assistance (e.g. for parsing the input or converting it to some other input format), we might also be able to assist.

The current timeline for the HTN IPC is set out on the track's website: https://ipc2023-htn.github.io/
The next step in the process is the initial planne submission on 28.02.2023. For this step, you don't need anything that really works yet -- a git repository that contains dummy files is enough.
If you are interested in participating: please let us know as soon as possible - s.t. we can set up everything and assist you if necessary.

If you can't or don't want to participate with a planner, we are also still looking for domains to use as benchmarks. If you have any, then please let us know! A rough idea for a domain would also be appreciated!

Kind regards,
Ron, Dominik, Gregor
